        <h2>Getting started with Influx</h2>
        <p>
          This firm grew rapidly. As is often the case with businesses on the
          fast track, they encountered a common challenge: their internal sales
          team was swamped with a flood of inbound leads. Recognizing the need
          to streamline their sales development efforts, the company made the
          strategic decision to explore outsourcing as a simple solution.
          <br />
          In their search for the right partner, they turned to Influx,
          initially launching with a team of three sales representatives.
          Achieving significant progress in lead qualification and conversion
          rates, Later, they expanded their outsourced team to five, seven, and
          then 10 SDRs— a decision that allowed them to reduce their internal
          team for a more cost-effective solution.
          <br />
          Working with Influx, they were able to handle a higher volume of
          qualified leads, close more deals, and generate over $1.6 million in
          revenue over five months.
