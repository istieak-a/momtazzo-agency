        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          A growing healthcare marketplace platform struggles to keep up with
          increased call volumes and unpredictable spikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This healthcare platform experienced tremendous growth (6-15% per
          month), stretching their 50 support agent team. By partnering with
          Influx, they were able to keep up with growth, while maintaining an
          excellent customer experience.
        </p>
        <h2>The Need</h2>
        <p>
          The healthcare marketplace required a robust customer service solution
          for its high-volume inquiries. Here’s what they needed to meet the
          demand:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            24/7 omnichannel support - Due to the nature of the healthcare
            industry, the company needed a 24/7 omnichannel solution delivering
            voice, live chat, email, and SMS to help their internal team handle
            over:
            <ul>
              <li>5,000-8,000 calls/week</li>
              <li>1,000 live chat tickets/week</li>
              <li>300-400 emails/week</li>
              <li>4,000 SMS tickets/week</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Workforce management systems - The platform needed strict adherence
            to work schedules to ensure no calls were missed. Workforce
            management systems would guarantee not only the right people are
            rostered and showing up, but active and available to take calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated recruitment, training, and management - With a 50-person
            support team of their own to manage, the healthcare marketplace
            needed sufficient management for their outsourced team. They needed
            a support provider capable of delivering end-to-end recruitment
            processes and thorough agent compliance training tailored to the
            platform and its audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, quality assurance was a key support need, with regular
            audits and performance assessments to maintain high standards across
            all channels. The marketplace platform came to Influx for help.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Influx initially launched a pilot-phase team of 15 CX professionals
          with dedicated team leadership for 24/7 coverage. Within 3 months, the
          company scaled their Influx team to 60+ full-time customer support
          specialists across 6 regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Influx agent was pre-vetted and pre-trained for an accurate and
          compliant onboarding process to ensure top-notch quality assurance
          through every customer interaction. Influx established tiers of
          management with workforce management expertise, including predictions,
          attritions, coaching, and volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 60-person team not only provides first-rate customer support, but
          also auditing, reporting, and customer processes.
        </p>
        <h2>The Results</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Call management: Influx agents decreased abandon call rate by 10X by
            using our award-winning internal playbook, SPEED.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quality assurance: Each Influx agent is required to pass a monthly,
            product knowledge assessment with a 90% or higher.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customer satisfaction: Influx has received zero customer complaints,
            driven by our unique in-house customer soft skills program, and
            maintains a 94% CSAT, exceeding a 90% target.
          </li>
          <li>
            Schedule adherence - Influx’s daily shrinkage consistently remains
            below 10%.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inbound + outbound voice support: Influx agents handle an average of
            50-60 calls per agent each day, with a handle time of 6-8 minutes
            per call.
          </li>
        </ul>
