          Mobile app with 30 million global users improves CSAT from 90% to 94%

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          An audiobook app company with 30 million users and a small customer
          service team needed to scale with an increased volume of ~7,000
          tickets/month.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a successful marketing campaign, this subscription-based service
          saw a huge spike in customer inquiries, which grew ticket volume to
          around 7,000/month. The company’s small internal team became inundated
          by the sudden increase in tickets — particularly during evenings and
          weekends. This after-hours backlog prevented the business from being
          able to catch up, and severely impacted first response time (FRT).
        </p>
        <p>In 2018, the company came to Montazzo for help.</p>
        <h2>The Need</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Weekend + after-hours extended coverage — to address customer
            concerns promptly and reduce the internal team’s piling backlog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prompt first response time (FRT) — to improve service quality and
            responsiveness.
          </li>
          <li>
            A flexible, scalable support solution — to manage spikes in ticket
            volume for a consistent, high-quality support experience year-round.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The company sought a high-quality support solution to ensure seamless
          service delivery and maintain a reputation for excellence.
        </p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As an extension of the company’s internal team, Montazzo provided a
          Support as a Service solution of 6 dedicated agents in 3 regions. This
          solution provided customers with 24/7 coverage, enabling real-time
          support no matter the time of day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Montazzo team handled ⅓ of total ticket volume (roughly 2,000-3,000
          tickets/month) via email, to achieve:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An 80% reduction in first response time (FRT) from ~40 hours to
            &gt;8 hours
          </li>
          <li>
            An increase in customer satisfaction score (CSAT) from 90% to 94+%{" "}
          </li>
          <li>An average response of 60 tickets/day/agent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since the partnership began in 2018, Montazzo acts as a flexible layer
          of support, scaling up or down depending on the company’s ticket
          volume to maintain consistent, high-quality coverage throughout the
          year.
