          How Montazzo Helped A Leading Innovator Confront Inclusion Gaps
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="case-study-con">
        <p>
          Our client stands at the forefront of technological innovation. For
          over two decades, they have pushed boundaries in search, AI, and
          software – bettering lives through empowering information and
          data-driven solutions.
        </p>
        <h2>The Need for Inclusive Data</h2>
        <p>
          This trailblazing company shoulders great responsibility. How do we
          ensure all groups benefit from life-changing technologies as
          capabilities advance? How can diverse needs and preferences be
          consistently understood?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our partner set ambitious inclusion goals – wanting products that
          resonate across their global user base. However, achieving equitable
          AI requires expansive datasets…and representation gaps persist.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this particular instance, the client needed to enhance visual
          recognition for its Pixel photo software through a more diverse data
          set of facial imagery. Data for users with darker skin tones proved
          notably lacking. The client partnered with Montazzo on a mission to fill
          this critical gap – collecting 50,000 photo ID videos of people with
          undertrained skin tones each month.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Montazzo: Unrivaled Geographic Reach</h2>
        <p>
          With operations centers spanning strategic African regions, Montazzo
          maintains unparalleled on-the-ground access to a rich diversity of
          black communities and offers teams that innately grasp intricacies
          around language, culture, logistics, and demographics.
        </p>
        <p>
          This powerful localized presence enabled swift, tailored recruitment;
          within 14 days, Montazzo had developed hyper-targeted campaigns and tapped
          willing participants across five countries to match the client’s
          criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an added advantage, having teams with a grasp of local contexts
          allowed for nimble adaptation to challenges. When pandemic impacts
          threatened timelines, our distributed model pivoted quickly across
          locations, minimizing delays through coordinated troubleshooting.
        </p>
        <p>Montazzo's commitment to inclusion and execution were game-changing</p>
        <h2>Seasoned Data Practices Aligned to ML Rigor</h2>
        <p>
          As veterans managing large-scale global data projects, Montazzo brought
          battle-hardened practices to uphold quality:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Multi-layer QA defenses prevent errors, with automated checks
            supplemented by manual reviews of issues like motion blur.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sensor arrays and capture methods purpose-built for computer vision
            ensure consistent ML-grade inputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specialist privacy/consent teams handle identification ethically
            across regions, supporting inclusion with cultural awareness.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At Montazzo, protocols are tailored to each client’s parameters. For this
          client, the team created five custom environments (outdoors, kitchen,
          living room, bedroom, office) and mapped out the different equipment
          specifications for each to ensure the IDs collected aligned with the
          model’s guardrails.
        </p>
        <h2>The Outcome: Progressing Inclusion</h2>
        <p>In just three months, Montazzo delivered the entire project scope:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            600,000 tailored photo IDs collected (against a 12-month target for
            the same number of IDs)
          </li>
          <li>97% participating acceptance rate</li>
          <li>3-4% opportunity cost, far below 10% goal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But more than metrics is needed to capture the full impact. With new
          voices represented, facial recognition technology will be better
          equipped to see diverse users; experiences will feel more welcoming,
          and friction will fade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our partner is propelling this progress across products. As computer
          vision continues advancing, segments once left behind are now factored
          into the future. “Montazzo’s commitment to inclusion and execution were
          game-changing,” noted Michelle Z., the client’s Machine Learning Lead.
          “This data unlocks innovation that serves and empowers more people.”
