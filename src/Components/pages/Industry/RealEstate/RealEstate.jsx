        <h1>Growth in the Global Real Estate Market</h1>
        <p>
          The global real estate market was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021 and
          is expected to grow, between 2022 and 2030, at a compound annual
          growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2%. This growth is largely driven by the
          rebound of the real estate industry post-pandemic. This rebound is
          attributed to an increase in the residential market for home and
          personal spaces that cater for remote work and the commercial market's
          need to introduce hybrid and return-to-work office schemes.
        </p>

        <p>
          These market changes have real estate organizations restructuring
          their operations to support a forecasted growth in demand while
          balancing interest rate rises. The most popular way to support
          anticipation of business growth is to hire additional employees. But
          that means increasing employment costs - so how can real estate
          organizations keep these costs minimal but maintain high levels?
        </p>

        <p>
          Outsourcing. By hiring offshore employees, you not only can minimize
          employment costs but also offer the necessary flexibility and support
          to your onshore employees to focus on nurturing client relationships
          and creating growth strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.
        </p>

        <h1>What are the Benefits of Real Estate Outsourcing?</h1>

          What are the Most Frequently Outsourced Real Estate Roles and
          Functions?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Real estate is a large industry, meaning that there isnâ€™t just a
          handful of roles that are suited to outsourcing. Your outsourced team
          is an extension of your business, so organizations often hire roles
          they could source onshore but for a fraction of the price.
