          Here are 5 tips that will help you make an ongoing success of your
          offshore team.
        </h1>

        <h4>TIP 1</h4>
        <h2>Take the time</h2>
        <img src="https://www.microsourcing.com/hubfs/MicroSourcing_May2020/Images/mic_MS_MicroSourcing-take_the_time.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          MicroSourcing take the time Offshoring is an opportunity to expand
          your business faster and save on costs. However, to make it work
          you’ll need to invest time up front. It’s not a ‘set and forget’
          solution. You need to train, mentor and speak with your offshore team
          on an ongoing basis, just as you do with your onshore team. This will
          improve the quality of service for both you and your customers, and
          consequently lead to a stronger return on investment.
        </p>

        <h4>TIP 2</h4>
        <h2>Treat your offshore team like your onshore team</h2>
        <img src="https://www.microsourcing.com/hubfs/MicroSourcing_May2020/Images/mic_MS_MicroSourcing-team-2.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Your offshore team is part of your business. And they’re people. Just
          like your local (onshore) team, they’ll perform best when they feel
          included and when they have excellent working relationships with their
          colleagues and managers. So be sure to talk to them and build strong
          relationships. This will help them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Live and breathe your culture</li>
          <li>Align with your vision</li>
          <li>Work towards your company goals</li>
          <li>Develop a rapport with your local (onshore) teams</li>
          <li>Be happier and more productive in their roles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>TIP:</strong> Simple programs like Skype, Google Meet, Zoom
          and GoToMeeting make it super easy to have face-to-face team huddles.
        </p>

        <h4>TIP 3</h4>
        <h2>Dedicate ‘champions’ to manage them</h2>
        <img src="https://www.microsourcing.com/hubfs/MicroSourcing_May2020/Images/mic_MS_MicroSourcing-champions.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          Your offshore team is a critical part of your business. You need to
          equip them with the knowledge, skills and attitude they’ll need to
          fill that role. Just as importantly, you need to ensure excellent team
          cohesion, collaboration and goal alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to do this is to dedicate two ‘champions’ to your
          offshore team – one onshore and one offshore. Their role is to glue
          your two teams together, making it far more likely you’ll achieve the
          outcomes you seek, and far less likely you’ll experience any of the
          problems that disconnection and distance can cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your onshore champion should manage and communicate with your offshore
          team. Your champion will be someone who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Has an intimate understanding of your business and culture</li>
          <li>Your offshore team can come to with questions</li>
          <li>Provides clarification and guidance to your offshore team</li>
          <li>Hosts regular meetings with your offshore team</li>
          <li>Checks in with individuals on your offshore team</li>
          <li>Is responsible for your offshore team’s performance</li>
          <li>Provides feedback and encouragement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s not just about knowledge transfer, either. It’s also something of
          a cultural transfer. Your onshore champion has to provide information
          and insight that your offshore team couldn’t get simply by reading
          your website. They need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deliver clear responsibilities and KPIs</li>
          <li>Manage people based on outcomes</li>
          <li>Allow people flexibility</li>
          <li>
            Communicate – having good systems in place for communication is
            especially important with a remote team
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Again, it comes back to treating your offshore members as part of the
          team. Even though they are not sat in the office right next to you,
          they're still a very real part of your company. You need to make sure
          they’re engaged – just like the rest of your employees. Fortunately,
          these days, technology makes this a lot easier than it used to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your offshore champion will be your onshore champion’s main point of
          contact, and the person on the ground who coordinates your offshore
          team’s day-to-day time and tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’ll have their ‘finger on the pulse’ of your offshore team in a
          way that’s only possible for someone local to achieve. They’ll
          typically be a senior manager or team leader – one of your early
          offshore hires, and someone you feel confident working with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally you’ll fly your offshore champion home to visit your local
          office for a few weeks, at least once a year. This will solidify the
          relationship and give them an excellent understanding of your
          business.
        </p>

        <h4>TIP 4</h4>
        <h2>Visit your offshore team regularly</h2>
        <img src="https://www.microsourcing.com/hs-fs/hubfs/MicroSourcing/MicroSourcing_May2020/Images/mic_MS_MicroSourcing-take_the_time.jpg?width=1052&height=449&name=mic_MS_MicroSourcing-take_the_time.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          Visiting your offshore team and facilities is a must. It’s best to
          organize a trip when you first set up the team, and then visit
          regularly after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fly over and take a few days to work with your team on the ground. Get
          to know your staff properly and allow them to get to know you.
          Face-to-face conversations help make your business, its goals and its
          customers a clear reality to your offshore team members (rather than
          remote concepts). If your offshore team understand who they’re working
          with, and more importantly why, they’ll deliver far better service
          quality and results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visiting your staff in person will also give you an insight into their
          strengths and weaknesses, so you can better allocate resources to
          appropriate tasks and make decisions about advancement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, while you’re visiting, chances are you’ll get to meet other
          business owners and managers who are offshoring too. This is obviously
          great from a networking point of view, but – more importantly – it’s a
          great way of exchanging best practices with other clients.
        </p>

        <h4>TIP 5</h4>
        <h2>Create clear systems and processes</h2>
        <img src="https://www.microsourcing.com/hubfs/MicroSourcing_May2020/Images/mic_MS_MicroSourcing-man_monitor_behind.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          Clear systems will help your team do their jobs effectively, and
          you’ll see a quicker return on your investment through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>More efficient work</li>
          <li>Higher job satisfaction</li>
          <li>Better staff accountability and clear KPIs</li>
          <li>Better quality control</li>
          <li>Predictable outcomes</li>
          <li>Consistent products, services and brand representation</li>
          <li>Consistent customer experiences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          MicroSourcing has a great deal of experience in all of these areas.
          We’ll walk you through the process of setting up your systems and
          processes, and once you’re up and running, we’ll offer proactive
          advice whenever we see an opportunity for improvement.
