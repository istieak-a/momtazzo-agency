          Want to know more about outsourced digital marketing services? Or even
          how you can work with an online advertising company in the
          Philippines? You’re in the right place.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="section-container">
        <p>
          Few teams encompass as diverse a range of roles as a digital marketing
          team. You have everyone from the people who plan your marketing
          content to the people who create it (in all its forms) right through
          to the people who drive traffic to it. And everyone in between.
        </p>

        <p>
          This vast range of skill sets, coupled with the fact that digital
          marketing is still very much in its infancy, means that it can be very
          difficult to find all the people you need locally. And even when you
          do manage to find them, they’re in such high demand that their asking
          price makes them practically unaffordable. You simply can’t afford to
          invest in the entire team you need, and even after investing in just a
          portion of the team you need, you’re left with very little capital to
          invest in other growth strategies or innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          But while local digital marketing professionals are expensive and in
          short supply, there are some countries where they’re readily available
          – at all levels of experience and seniority and with a much lower
          cost.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Philippines, for instance, you can employ an entire marketing
          team for the same salary that you’d pay for a single marketing person
          at home. Perhaps even less. Likewise, you can employ someone full-time
          offshore for about the same outlay as outsourcing job after job to
          freelancers, on a project basis. And then obviously you can reinvest
          the savings into your next marketing campaign! Outsourcing your
          digital marketing services to a team in the Philippines could help you
          scale and grow to meet your business objectives.
        </p>

        <h2>Offshoring Solves the Digital Marketing Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The most obvious opportunity for scale is that social media management
          has essentially become a 24/7 job. Customers expect – and in some
          cases demand – instant replies on social media, and it’s simply too
          much for one person to manage. The economic savings of an offshore
          team mean you can hire more people to cover more hours and to share
          the load. For about the same cost as hiring one local social media
          manager working Monday-Friday 9-5, you could run a 24/7 rotating
          roster offshore to maintain excellent customer service.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s not to say you should abandon your onshore team. Far from it…
        </p>

        <h2>Which Digital Marketing Team Roles Can Be Outsourced?</h2>
        <p>
          With Digital Marketing, you’re in luck. Because everything is digital,
          it’s easy to employ a team offshore.

        <h2>Common Digital Marketing Team Structure</h2>
        <p>
          The best way to set up an offshore digital marketing team is to start
          with 1-3 specialists – not a single generalist. Two (or three) heads
          are better than one, plus you’ll then have a team dynamic where people
          can brainstorm together, rather than trying to nut out problems on
          their own. This typically leads to innovation and superior problem
          solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have these offshore specialists report to a senior Digital Marketing
          Manager at home. Someone who can oversee their work and guide them in
          the marketing style and voice of your business.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ll benefit from a team of specialists who each have their defined
          roles as part of smaller team units. What’s more, when they’re all in
          the same offshore location, it’s easy for each team unit to work with
          the other subspecialties. Unlike working with a local online
          advertising company, in the Philippines, you can set up your own team
          who work exclusively for you, moving your projects forward and
          delivering on your objectives.
        </p>
        <img className="mx-auto" src={chart} alt="" />
        <p>
          Note that, although it can be tempting to go for a junior at the
          outset, to keep costs as low as possible, it’s usually better to
          employ someone a little more senior, with more experience. Remember,
          you’re growing a team here, not just employing one or two individuals.
          Before long, you’ll be reaping the rewards of your small offshore
          team, and you’ll be actively (and excitedly) seeking to reinvest your
          profits and grow the team. And when that time comes, it’ll be your
          seniors, offshore, who’ll be the mentors and managers for your new
          team members. And that’s when you can start employing more junior
          roles.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s also a good idea to hire offshore for the repetitive,
          labor-intensive roles, because living, labor, and occupancy costs are
          so much lower, which means you can keep your headcount costs low. Keep
          the thinking, strategy, and planning roles onshore, because you’ll
          need relatively few of these people, so you can afford to pay a little
          more for them. Plus, at least in your early days offshoring, these
          people will be the most familiar with your marketing goals, brand
          identity, style guidelines, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Offshore Content Marketing Team</h2>
        <p>
          A Content Marketing Manager leads the content team, working towards
          the strategy set by the onshore Digital Marketing Manager. Together
          they’ll oversee and produce all the marketing messages and visual
          content for your brand.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 1 of Your Content Marketing Team</h3>
        <p>Starts with a small core team:</p>
        <ul className="link-li">
          <li>Content Marketing Manager</li>
          <li>Copywriter/Content Writer</li>
          <li>Graphic Designer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Copywriter (or team of Copywriters) will produce all the written
          content for the marketing team. That includes everything from website
          pages, blogs or articles, social media post text, and paid search
          engine advertising text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your website, blogs, and social media posts all need to be
          eye-catching and on-brand, and that’s the role of your expert Graphic
          Designer. They’ll make sure your brand’s visuals are consistent across
          all your platforms. Most importantly, your Graphic Designer will be a
          whiz at creating custom artwork for promotions, and making your
          products look their best online or in print.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 2: Expanding Your Content Marketing Team</h3>
        <p>
          When you’re ready to grow and produce more sophisticated content. At
          this stage you’ll have employed (or contracted) local Photographers
          and Videographers to create stunning brand imagery and top-quality
          product photos. To save on costs, it’s easy to offshore the supporting
          roles of Photo Editor, Animator, and Video Editor to put the finishing
          touches on eye-catching promotions.
        </p>
        <ul className="link-li">
          <li>Photo Editor</li>
          <li>Video Editor</li>
          <li>Animator</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Finally, if you’re producing a lot of content, you’ll need a
          Proofreader as a final check and quality control for your content.
          It’s also efficient to have your own Web Developers upload all the
          content to your website and make sure it’s looking its best.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 3: Adding More Roles</h3>
        <p>To keep up with content production volumes:</p>
        <ul className="link-li">
          <li>Web Designer / Web Developer</li>
          <li>Proofreader</li>
          <li>
            Extra Copywriters, Content Writers, and Graphic Designers to cope
            with demand
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Offshore Search Engine Marketing Team</h2>
        <p>
          Search engine marketing works best when you split your team up into
          two specialist groups: the organic search engine optimization (SEO)
          team, and the paid ads team (search engine marketing (SEM) /
          pay-per-click (PPC)). They’ll work alongside each other, but they each
          have their particular focus.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your website isn’t making as many sales as you’d like, an SEO
          Specialist and SEO Copywriter can help your target customers find your
          business online. SEO specialists have the knack for getting into your
          customers’ heads and choosing just the right keywords to target.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within a few months, you’ll see your search rankings climb and your
          website conversion rate increase. Of course, if you have a huge
          website with hundreds of products, you’ll make faster gains by
          employing a team of SEO specialists to work together.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Organic SEO Specialists</li>
          <li>SEO Copywriter</li>
          <li>Marketing and Data Analyst</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Furthermore, paid ads appear at the very top of the search results, so
          they’re a great way to put your business front-and-center for
          customers who are in a hurry. SEM Specialists work out where to place
          your ads for the greatest conversion rate.
        </p>
        <ul className="link-li">
          <li>SEM/PPC Specialists</li>
          <li>PPC Ads Copywriter</li>
          <li>Marketing and Data Analyst</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          At the same time, SEM specialists use retargeting campaigns to capture
          even more sales. They’re the ads your customers see when they’ve
          visited your website but haven’t bought anything yet. The SEM team can
          also work with the Social Media Marketing team to place retargeting
          ads into your customer’s Facebook and Instagram feeds.
        </p>

        <p>
          To monitor your results, your team will produce analytics and
          conversion reports (or this task can go to a specialized Marketing &
          Data Analyst if you have one). Because there’s no point in spending
          money on paid advertising if you don’t monitor your ROI.
        </p>

        <h2>Offshore Social Media Marketing Team</h2>
        <p>
          Social platforms are a goldmine for customer acquisition and sales,
          and that’s where your Social Media Marketer really shines. It’s not
          surprising this is one of the most popular outsourced digital
          marketing services. They’re experts at planning and executing social
          media campaigns, launching new products, and keeping your brand
          front-of-mind for your customers.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s usually one senior Social Media Marketer, supported by a team
          of Social Media Managers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Social Media Marketer</li>
          <li>Up to 10 Social Media Managers</li>
          <li>Content Moderators</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Social Media Marketers are the glue between several subspecialties in
          the broader digital marketing team.
        </p>

        <p>
          To begin with, they work with Copywriters, Content Writers, and
          Graphic Designers to create the text and visuals for social posts. And
          they work with the SEM Specialists on retargeting ad strategy and
          content.
        </p>

        <p>
          And if the Social Media Marketers are doing their job well, your
          social media pages will have LOTS of customer engagement. Indeed, this
          probably means more you’ll need a Social Media Manager (or several) to
          keep up with the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Social Media Managers are responsible for uploading and scheduling
          content for posts, and replying to customers’ comments and direct
          messages (and inevitably, sometimes their complaints). In a small
          team, Social Media Managers also moderate your groups and forums, or
          you can employ dedicated Content Moderators if demand allows.
        </p>

        <p>
          What’s more, if your social media strategy is generating lots of
          customer engagement, monitoring it all can be a full-time,
          high-pressure job. So much so that it pays to have a team of people
          working together on a rotating roster, to share the load.
        </p>

        <h2>Growing Your Team</h2>
        <p>
          The important thing to remember is that once you get started with
          outsourcing digital marketing services, it’s super easy to grow your
          Digital Marketing team, either gradually or quickly, to suit your
          growing business.
        </p>

        <p>
          We suggest you start with the offshore roles that will give you the
          biggest returns first, and add more people as your business needs grow
          and change.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re not sure where to start, ask our team to suggest a basic
          Digital Marketing team structure that has worked for similar clients,
          and you can grow from there.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges that Offshore Digital Marketing Teams Can Face</h2>
        <p>
          While Filipinos are known for their exceptional English proficiency,
          your team might need some extra language training about your local
          jargon. It’s one key way to help Copywriters and Social Media
          Marketers sound as natural as possible in their writing and also in
          social media interactions with customers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The same language considerations apply for SEO/SEM keywords. For
          example, a thong is a very different product in American and
          Australian English, so if your business is in either footwear or
          lingerie, you want to make sure your team is targeting the right local
          keywords!
        </p>

        <p>
          When creating your team roster for social media management and content
          moderation, you’ll need to consider the time difference. If you’re in
          the US and your customers are most active on social media in your
          afternoon and evening, you’ll need to plan your offshore team’s roster
          accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          A good offshoring provider will set you up with a team that can work
          whatever hours you need them too, so the time zone difference should
          never be a factor. That said, the time difference can actually work in
          your favor. When US staff are finishing their work day, a Manila-based
          team is starting their day, so they can take care of your customers
          while your US team sleeps.
