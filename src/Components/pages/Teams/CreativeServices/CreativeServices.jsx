          From marketing and content writing to design and animation… you can
          outsource creative services and build the ultimate team to deliver on
          projects faster – working exclusively for your organization. But
          before you hire any creatives, here’s what you need to know about
          outsourcing creative design services to India…
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="section-container max-w-7xl mx-auto">
        <h1>Creative Services: The Reality Behind the Buzz</h1>
        <p>
          Creative services – it’s an exciting, if vague title, calling up
          images of perfectly pitched viral campaigns put together by the hip
          and stylish.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reality can be far more mundane and labor-intensive – not to
          mention bewildering and expensive – especially when you most need the
          branding momentum to take your business to the next level.
        </p>

        <h2>The Importance of Creative Roles</h2>
        <p>
          Creative roles can’t be dismissed as icing on the cake. Brand identity
          is vital in the modern market. Customer perceptions, loyalty,
          reputation, positioning — billions are spent every year tweaking
          campaign details to get in the right eyes, under the right light, then
          analyzing the outcome. There’s a growing push in the marketing field
          towards ‘omni-marketing’, which means campaigns with an integrated
          approach to touchpoints across all channels, creating a “seamless”
          customer experience. That’s a tall order for the odd half-hour gaps
          between meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research by marketing analyst group Smart Insights shows two-thirds of
          businesses surveyed last year had already begun or were planning to
          initiate a digital marketing transformation within the year. That
          takes expertise, particularly with marketing trends stampeding towards
          cutting-edge techniques like voice marketing and AI. And, of course,
          it takes money…
        </p>

        <h2>Cost of Creative Talent</h2>
        <p>
          The base salary for a creative services manager in the United States
          averaged $63,723 in 2019, according to data from Glassdoor.com, rising
          to over $150,000 in some companies, with digital marketing specialists
          not far behind at $60,714. In Australia, advertising copywriters’
          salaries ranged from $78,000 Australian dollars up to well over
          $100,000. So it’s not hard to see that putting together even a small
          team of competent local creatives would soon be pushing your budget
          boundaries, even before paying site costs and software upgrades.
        </p>

        <h2>Traditional Alternatives</h2>
        <p>
          Traditionally, companies had three main alternatives to an entirely
          in-house creative services department: outsourcing creative services
          to a local creative agency, using freelancers, or a combination of a
          smaller in-house team supported by external agencies or supplemented
          by freelancers. Each option has its advantages and drawbacks:
        </p>

        <h2>Agency</h2>
        <p>
          Finding a full-service professional agency may seem to be the most
          reassuring option, but it can also be the most costly. Companies like
          this tend to be very invested in their own signature style. You’re
          paying them for their trained opinion – so if relinquishing ownership
          of your own creative vision is a wrench, this may not be the best way
          to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, a contract with a creative company will also involve
          additional fees for any unforeseen amendments to the original work
          done, and new contracts for updated campaign aspects. Copyright of the
          concepts may even remain with the agency under the basic quote. If you
          think it’s likely these issues will hold your business back,
          outsourcing creative services to an agency may not be the best
          solution.
        </p>

        <h2>Freelancers</h2>
        <p>
          A photoshoot here, a copywriter there – a shifting band of freelancers
          can be a good intermediate option for growing companies, allowing the
          flexibility of upfront fees, obligation-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as your creative requirements grow more sophisticated, the juggle
          can become more trouble than it’s worth. Can you spare the
          administrative manpower to keep track of the different contracts and
          make sure you’re getting a fair rate? Without the unifying vision of a
          skilled creative manager, you may end up with a patchy, unprofessional
          end product.
        </p>

        <h2>Mix and Match?</h2>
        <p>
          A skeleton in-house team bolstered by freelancers, or supported by a
          creative agency, may be a good compromise – you retain more control
          while benefiting from targeted professional guidance and extra
          freelance talent as needed. But does it really end up much more
          cost-effective than keeping it all in the company? Can you spare the
          administrative hours to keep track of the different contracts and
          rates? And will the arrangement fall apart when you need a powerful,
          cohesive effort to support rebranding or a big product launch? Writing
          that kind of risk with brand identity into your long term plans isn’t
          good business.
        </p>

        <h2>The Offshore Alternative</h2>
        <p>
          Fortunately for today’s companies, the digital age brings innovative
          options for sourcing creative talent along with the increasing
          pressure to perform in that department. Outsourcing creative and
          design services roles overseas is one way companies can leverage the
          expertise of experienced creative professionals for far less than they
          would be able to afford to spend on equivalent talent back home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only does this cut costs dramatically, it allows you to maintain
          control and ownership of your creative processes and materials. And
          you can be confident in a unified team of skilled branding, digital,
          and design professionals working synergistically with your creative
          leads and true to your vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, an entirely new industry has sprung up around this type of
          offshoring. It’s called creative process outsourcing (CPO), and it
          evolved from the traditional business process outsourcing (BPO) that
          India is renowned for. In India, with its
          well-educated, articulate, English-speaking labor force, established
          offshoring providers can help you put together a customized and
          affordable creative team of seasoned professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the right help, you can find creatives with a demonstrated track
          record of creating successful campaigns similar to what your company
          needs, perhaps also with experience working together, and a creative
          manager to convey your design and branding needs to the team quickly
          and accurately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, buoyed by streamlined social media, advertising, and online
          communications, your customer engagement will increase exponentially,
          and you’ll be needing all your staff at home to focus on sales and
          development just to meet the increased demand.
        </p>

        <h2>Commonly Outsourced Creative Services Roles</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes for a busy non-creative, it’s hard to get an idea of what
          roles fall into the category, where branding ends and marketing
          begins, and how much ends up being IT, anyway? The scope of creative
          outsourcing solutions covers all marketing and advertising functions
          and processes, as well as the technical, artistic, and administrative
          roles that support them.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some of the support creative services roles that are
          commonly outsourced to India. The people in these jobs put
          into practice the branding and marketing strategies devised by
          creative executives. They come up with the artwork according to
          briefs, write the copy for all platforms, and drive customers back to
          your website to increase sales. They create the look and user
          interface for the web presence – as well as the flash or animation
          ‘bells and whistles’ to catch the public’s fickle eye. These skilled
          team members also maintain and update marketing materials once the
          brand image has been established.

        </ul>
        <p>
          The following more senior creative roles are also commonly outsourced,
          allowing businesses to delegate their creative planning and
          development offshore as well as the execution:
        </p>
        <ul className="link-li grid gap-3 md:grid-cols-2">
          <li>Brand Strategist</li>

          <li>Marketing Specialist</li>
          <li>Marketing Manager</li>

          <li>Managing Director</li>
          <li>Production Manager</li>
          <li>Traffic Managers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Go Big or (Stay) Home?</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you’re outsourcing your creative services roles overseas or to
          local providers, you need to make the decision whether to start on a
          small scale – a photographer here, a copywriter there, to buy yourself
          some time to work on your core business responsibilities – or to
          offshore the entire team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the particular synergies and workflow of creative departments,
          it can often be a better choice to engage or create an entire
          outsourced creative team. And if you choose to outsource to the
          Philippines, this is an achievable goal for a modest outlay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because so many different talents and tasks must be woven together to
          create a company’s brand – often at great speed – having those people
          all together in one place is more efficient, as well as more rewarding
          for them. Good creatives take pride in their work, which depends on
          collaboration and ingenuity. They tend not to thrive in a vacuum.
          Celebrating successes, working together to iron out knots – all these
          things build staff loyalty and wellbeing, which translates to a
          stronger result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as importantly, setting up an offshore creative team also allows
          you to maintain more direct management of the processes and staff than
          you would if you engaged local creative services companies to take
          over your accounts. (And naturally it would cost you a lot less.)
        </p>

        <h2>The Fundamentals – A Basic Creative Team</h2>
        <p>
          An outsourced creative team could mean just a few targeted individuals
          working to briefs provided by a creative director at home; or it could
          be an entire advertising cohort from director to proofreader.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals in smaller creative teams, whether in-house or outsourced,
          design and execute advertising campaigns for their companies or client
          companies. They create copy and artwork for various media, which can
          include anything from simple brochures and print media ads, to social
          media campaigns, including both passive placement and overt brand
          profiles, proprietary websites, banner ads for web platforms, email
          campaigns, newsletters, blogs, or even podcasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small, start-up, outsourced creative design services team is
          typically composed of the following:
        </p>
        <ul className="link-li grid gap-3 md:grid-cols-3">
          <li>Brand Strategist</li>
          <li>Creative Manager/Director</li>
          <li>Web Developer</li>
          <li>Digital Marketing Specialist</li>
          <li>Graphic Artist</li>
          <li>Copywriter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An organization chart for this no-frills team might look something
          like this:
        </p>
        <img className="mx-auto w-[70%]" src={chart1} alt="" />
        <p>
          You’ll notice the multi-directional hierarchy, an important element in
          a modern creative team. While copywriters and graphic designers will
          receive instruction from the digital marketing specialists and the web
          developer, they’ll also be called on for special commissions from the
          onshore team via the creative services manager, and their input is an
          important part of collaborative project development within the team.
        </p>

        <h2>Creative Services Manager</h2>
        <p>
          A creative manager is in charge of making sure the team’s work
          complies with professional standards and company policy, and with the
          briefs delivered from home base. They will help choose the rest of the
          creative team, with input from your offshoring provider and the
          onshore liaison, and oversee training and development. On a day-to-day
          basis, the creative manager will supervise progress, give direction,
          and make sure production targets are being met. It’s very important to
          have a strong relationship with your off-shored creative manager, as
          they will become your representative in the field.
        </p>

        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the increasing importance of social media platforms to connect
          with customers, a professional, easy-to-use website is still a
          business essential, especially if you also offer online sales. Web
          developers construct websites from the ground up and must be skilled
          in all the relevant programming languages, such as Javascript, HTML,
          and CSS – especially if they are the sole developer on a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a creative team, the web developer will liaise with the creative
          manager to design the flow and functions of the website, writing and
          testing bespoke software, debugging the system, and setting up access
          to databases and network servers. They’ll ensure the site is optimized
          for mobile devices, that sales platforms are secure, and that all
          functions are consistent across all access points. Their scaffold will
          be dressed with the artwork and content contributed by graphic
          designers and copywriters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers almost always work hand-in-hand with web designers, who are
          more concerned with the look of the site. In larger teams, they’ll
          also work with user experience (UX) specialists who design
          user-friendly website journeys for visitors, information architecture
          (IA) specialists who structure bigger websites and design navigation
          and page flows, and testing professionals who ensure the finished site
          is bug-free, fully functional, and consistent across all web browsers.
          You may also decide to add animators to work with your developers to
          enhance your web and digital offerings.
        </p>

        <h2>Digital Marketing Specialist</h2>
        <p>
          Facebook and Instagram and Pinterest – oh my! It’s a digital jungle
          out there and a company needs a canny navigator even to find their
          feet, let alone use it to drive profits. In just one example, recent
          research by Oberlo shows that there are 1 billion active Instagram
          accounts, with 500 million people using it on a daily basis. Different
          demographics dominate different social platforms, and more are popping
          up every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          A digital marketing specialist is a marketing professional who designs
          media campaigns for online and social media platforms. They must also
          have a solid grasp of search engine optimization (SEO) principles,
          paid search (PPC) options, such as GoogleAds, display media
          placements, and the different forms of digital analytics, in order to
          best drive online brand promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’ll provide input to other creatives on how to optimize design and
          writing for the digital space, how to ensure different platforms are
          connected and working in a complementary fashion, as well as
          developing special offerings such as competitions and email campaigns
          to promote new products or services. Always staying on top of the
          latest trends, they’ll develop a strategy for a brand’s social media
          presence, and in a small team, will probably also manage social media
          accounts. Social media management also plays an increasingly important
          role in customer service, with 59% of Americans saying it has made it
          easier to get their questions answered and issues resolved, (Lyfe
          Marketing, 2018) and positive customer service experiences, in turn,
          drive positive impressions of a company, which drive sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a larger team, the digital marketing specialist would be overseeing
          other digital roles, which may include dedicated SEO specialists, SEM
          or PPC specialists, or market data analysts, as well as social media
          assistants and moderators.
        </p>

        <h2>Copywriter</h2>
        <p>
          A mercifully straightforward job title for a very important role.
          Copywriters provide the words to engage customers and make them want
          to hear more about your company’s offerings. They provide content for
          all marketing materials from print to social. This includes blogging,
          which is increasingly regarded as a primary marketing tool, with 55%
          of marketers identifying blog content creation as their top inbound
          marketing priority, according to a 2018 HubSpot survey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Copywriters need a superior command of written English, including a
          flair for syntax and usage. They will have excellent grammar and
          spelling, an eye for detail, creativity and imagination, and the
          ability to stay on top of emerging trends and techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s also important that copywriters are able to communicate well with
          their teammates because they will be interpreting the messages of
          marketing campaigns, and adjusting their expression as appropriate for
          different platforms. They may also serve as de facto information
          architecture (UX) specialists and information architects (IAs) on
          smaller teams.
        </p>

        <h2>Graphic/Web Designer</h2>
        <p>
          Graphic/web designers create the artwork and copy styles crucial in
          establishing a brand identity. Using briefs and design concepts
          development by creative leads, graphic designers put together
          illustrations, draft layouts, font suites and fine branding details to
          be used across all media communications for a consistent aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          They liaise with web developers and branding strategists as marketing
          concepts evolve, and ensure that new content is in line with the
          company’s image. They also liaise with the team’s copywriters (and, on
          larger teams, information architecture (UX) specialists and
          information architects (IAs)).
        </p>
        <p>
          In a larger creative services team, your designers would work with
          specialized art workers such as video editors and animators to
          customize the company’s online materials.
        </p>

        <h2>Leveling Up</h2>
        <p>
          The beauty of outsourcing generally is the ability to scale up your
          off-shore team as your business and needs expand. And creative
          services roles can be targeted and differentiated with minute
          precision.

          Contrary to what might be your instincts when first setting up a
          starter creative team, it’s better to splurge on more experienced
          senior or intermediate staff at the outset. The relative cost compared
          to hiring an equivalent cadre of employee at home will still be
          miniscule, but their ability to hit the ground running and act quickly
          to implement your needs will be substantially greater.

          If you decide you’d like to grow your outsourced creative services
          team, having experienced senior workers on site will make that job
          much easier, because they can function as team leaders. Even if you
          end up hiring new management-level employees at the top end of the
          hierarchy, existing experienced creatives with seniority will have
          better insight into what skills would best enhance the team in new
          junior hires. Their professional standing, combined with their
          knowledge of your company will also put them in a better position to
          train and mentor newcomers while the whole team adjusts to the new
          workflow.

          The structure of a larger outsourced creative services team is similar
          to that of a small advertising firm:
        </p>
        <ul className="link-li grid md:grid-cols-3">
          <li>Managing Director</li>
          <li>Account Manager</li>
          <li>Creative Manager</li>
          <li>Digital Marketing Specialist</li>
          <li>Web Developer</li>
          <li>Web Designer (UI/UX)</li>
          <li>Graphic/Multimedia Artist</li>
          <li>Content Writer/Editor</li>
          <li>Copywriter</li>
          <li>Production Coordinator</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This chart gives an idea of how a more complex creative services team
          may be structured, although it’s important to add that the
          organization of advertising and marketing teams is in itself the topic
          of advanced study. There are multiple theories set out in marketing
          literature, and it’s worth doing some research in consultation with
          your offshored management to see which would best suit your company’s
          priorities – always with the understanding that adjustments can be
          made as your needs change.

          There are many other supporting technology-oriented roles that might
          fit within this structure underneath the digital and web leaders,
          including (but not limited to) animators, video specialists, UX/UI
          (user experience) web experts, SEO analysts, or even game designers.
          Content managers and photo editors are often engaged to support web
          developers and content editors. With a large team of copywriters, or
          just a heavy load of writing, it might also be a good idea to include
          proofreaders.
