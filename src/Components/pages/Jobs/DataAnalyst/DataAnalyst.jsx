          Data analysts are responsible for organizing, analyzing and
          interpreting business information and raw data to assist in
          decision-making activities. These activities include suggestions to
          reduce business costs, improve on existing inefficiencies and increase
          revenue streams. They can collate statistical data in a way that
          non-technical stakeholders can easily understand.

        <p>Data analysts are also known as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data scientists</li>
          <li>Business analysts</li>
          <li>Data statisticians</li>
          <li>Data specialists</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The global data analytics market is expected to grow from US $37.34
          billion in 2018 to US $105.08 billion by 2027, with a compound annual
          growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3% from 2019 to 2027. This can be attributed
          to the increase in data volumes and the adoption of “big data” tools
          to generate revenue growth. The increased complexity and volume of
          data globally are linked to mobile data traffic, cloud computing, and
          technology adoption, including artificial intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
          To keep up with this anticipated growth, data management companies
          need to identify ways to hire quality data analysts and keep
          employment costs low without jeopardizing quality. A solution;
          outsourcing.
        </p>

          to the Philippines is simple and cost-effective.
        </p>

            increasing profits and business growth and development
            opportunities. The additional capacity that your onshore team gets
            from your offshore team's support means you can grow your business
            sustainably.

          What Qualifications, Skills and Experience Make a Successful Data
          Analyst?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Data analysts require a statistical and mathematically focused mindset
          and high attention to detail. They need to possess the skills to
          interpret large data sets and investigate cost reduction strategies
          for businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Data analysts need to be able to ‘marry’ their data interpretation
          experience with being able to use financial modeling tools to
          communicate recommendations for change to key stakeholders
          effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of qualifications and education, a degree or certificate in
          mathematics, statistics, computer science or information technology is
          necessary given the role's analytical and mathematical nature.
          Depending on the expertise required, previous experience in data
          analysis roles can help with the effective extraction of key points
          from data sets.

        <h2>Tips for Employing Filipino Data Analysts</h2>
        <p>
          Your data analysts must know your business's systems and software to
          provide the best level of support for your data management services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ensure that you let your talent acquisition team in the Philippines
          know the size of projects and plans your ideal offshore data analysts
          will be working on. Employing an offshore team member who has had
          experience will better understand timelines and expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can recruit as many data analysts as required from project to
          project and can even hire senior data analysts in the Philippines to
          manage your offshore teams. If/when you grow your offshore team to
          several staff, having one team lead can ensure streamlined
          communication and project updates are effectively delivered to your
          onshore team.
